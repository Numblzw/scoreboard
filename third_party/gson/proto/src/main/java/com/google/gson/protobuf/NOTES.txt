This file is generated by checking out the path:

  //proto/src/main/java/com/google/gson/protobuf/ProtoTypeAdapter.java

And replacing all instances of 'GeneratedMessage' with 'AbstractMessage':

  sed -i 's/GeneratedMessage/AbstractMessage/g'

This isn't really suitable for upstreaming because it drops all kinds of other
types in as candidates for deserialising too (even if they'll never actually get
used).

The proper fix is to change this weird inheritance structure so that the
following statement from GeneratedMessage javadoc is either actually true or not
needed any more:

  "All [sic] generated protocol message classes extend this class"
